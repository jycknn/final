                <h3>Childhood in Castille</h1>

                <p>Blessed Cecilia Caesarini, who was received by St. Dominic into his new order, in her old age described him thus : He was thin and of middle
                    height. His face was handsome and somewhat fair. He had reddish hair and beard and beautiful eyes. From his forehead and eyes shown a sort of
                    radiance which drew everyone to respect and love him. He was always cheerful and alert, except when he was moved to compassion at the sight
                    of someone's troubles. His hands were long and fine and his voice pleasingly resonant. He never got bald, though he wore the full tonsure,
                    which was mingled with a few grey hairs.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of Dominic de Guzman's life is chiefly based on the Libellus of Jordan of Saxony, his successor as head of the Order of
                    Preachers which Dominic founded. Jordan knew Dominic personally and wrote only about twelve years after his death, but had not been one of
                    his close companions. The Libellus, although written to promote Dominic's canonization in 1234 is disappointingly sketchy. It tells us more
                    about the origins of the Order than the personality of the founder. Unlike the Franciscans, the early followers of St. Dominic never showed much
                    interest in their founder's cult and seemed to have feared that too much popular devotion to him might hinder the mission he had entrusted to
                    them</p>
                <p>Dominic was born between 1171 and 1173 in the Castilian village of Caleruega, son of Felix de Guzman and Jane of Aza of the Spanish nobility.
                    Christian Spain was still struggling to free itself from Moorish occupation and, even for a knightly family, life was austere in that stark, dry
                    region where Felix as local lord owned little more than range land, a few flocks of sheep, and the manor house and tower (still standing) which
                    served to guard the land. Jane of Aza was noted for her concern for the poor and was regarded by the local people as a saint.</p>

                <h3>From Osma to Denmark </h1>

                <p>When Dominic was seven his education was put in charge of Jane's brother, a priest, and when he was fourteen he entered the school at Palencia, one of the few higher schools in Spain at that time and soon to become a university, where he studied liberal arts and theology for ten years. He lived a rather bookish life but during a time of famine sold his books to assist the poor. In 1196, when he was about 24, he joined the cathedral chapter of Osma.</p>
                <p>The canons of the Cathedral were priests associated with the bishop who had recently seformed their community life to live strictly in poverty according to the Rule of St. Augustine. The prior and reformer of this chapter was the remarkable Diego de Azevedo who in 1201 became bishop of the diocese. It was he who had noticed Dominic the student and obtained permission of the former bishop, Martin Bazan, for him to enter the chapter and in a few months to be ordained priest. Soon Dominic was appointed sacristan, then sub-prior, thus gaining useful experience in administration and the work of reform.</p>
                <p>In 1203 when Alfonso VIII of Castile requested Bishop Diego to travel to Denmark to arrange the marriage of his son to a Danish princess, the bishop naturally chose the young priest to be his companion on the long, dangerous journey.</p>
